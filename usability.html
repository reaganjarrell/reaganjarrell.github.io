<h2>Method:</h2>
<p> The target audiance of my website is teenagers or young adults. The three tasks I assigned were:
Find and use the link to direct you to the Southwest website,
use the navigation to go to the javascript page and back to the home page, and
on the Javascript page, add one pair of socks to your shopping cart,</p>
<h2>Results:</h2>
<p>The subjects were able to complete the tasks assigned in good time but found minimal errors in the navigation. For most users, it did not take more than the necessary steps to complete the task, but some had to refresh or scroll from page to page to complete the task.</p>
<h2>Discussion: </h2>
<p>From this task, i've learned that I need to change the layout of my forum to make it more effective and easier to use. If the forum was less clumped together, it would be more accesible.</p>
