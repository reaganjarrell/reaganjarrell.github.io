	<h2>Unit 2</h2>
	<p>	Throughout this unit, I learned a collection of coding skills. First, I refreshed my general knowledge on how to set up the format of a page and how to save my files. Then, I learned new skills such as how to make a table, and how to add videos to my webpage. Finally, we added information to the coding to complete parts of the webpage. These are skills I can use in my future when begining to code a webpage.</p>

	<h2>Unit 3</h2>
	<p>	Throughout this unit we learned how to stylize our pages using CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We learned multiple new skills such as how to float a paragraph and how to change the backround color. We used the Box Model to arrange our information into a fitted format. We also learned how to label our sections into groups, using class, and into individual sections, using id. This is all helpful when styling your webpage.</p>
	<h2>Unit 4</h2>
	<p>Throughout this unit we learned how to add images into our website in many different forms. We learned how to link images to different links, creating buttons. We also learned how to make a small image a thumbnail for a larger image. This incoorperated many different skills in photoshop and illustrator. Some were resizing, manipulating images, and saving under folder types. We also learned how to create and size banners to fitin our webpages.</p>
	<h2>Unit 5</h2>
	<p>Throughout this unit, we learned how to add buttons that allow a function. For example, we added a hide/show clock button. We learned how to reate the clock then how to give it a function. We also learned functions such as how to show a message using a button.</p>
	<h2>Unit 6</h2>
	<p>In this unit we focused on testing our websites. We tested video game students on our website. They filled out a form that containeed three tasks and two questions on our website. Then we took notes, reviewed, and fixed our website. This allowed us to user test and make sure our website was fully functioning with no errors.</p>
	<h2>Unit 7</h2>
	<p>This section will include links to my work for this unit, once completed</p>
